It provides the following functionalities:
 - loading a card file from FileSystem of creating a new one; 
 - **viewing cards** in a *list* or *grid* manner;
 - **inserting**, **updating** or **deleting** cards;
 - **searching cards** by name;
 - **filtering cards** by some conditions, e.g. cards with less than 5 words for forbidden words or with duplicates.
 - It automatically saves the modifications on the file.
